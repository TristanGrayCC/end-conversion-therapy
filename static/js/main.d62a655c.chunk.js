I agree with you that, as well as the provision of conversion therapy, any ban must also include causing a person to undergo conversion therapy; removing a minor from Scotland to undergo conversion therapy abroad; and advertising an offer to provide conversion therapy. As you have outlined, I believe it is important that we engage with religious leaders on the impact of certain teachings on their LGBT members.  It is crucial that we also establish a public complaints mechanism for reports of conversion therapy and ensure there is support for survivors as well as awareness training for both the healthcare sector and religious organisations. One LGBT+ person being forced to undergo the trauma of conversion therapy is one too many.  I want to assure you of my unwavering support for your campaign and I pledge that I will be your friend and ally in putting an end to this shocking practice."},{Name:"\tMark Griffin\t",Party:a.ScottishLabourParty,Region:i.CentralScotland,RegionOnly:!0,RegionRank:3,Support:r.NoReply,Statement:"none"},{Name:"\tMonique McAdams\t",Party:a.ScottishLabourParty,Region:i.CentralScotland,RegionOnly:!0,RegionRank:4,Support:r.NoReply,Statement:"none"},{Name:"\tChris Costello\t",Party:a.ScottishLabourParty,Region:i.CentralScotland,RegionOnly:!0,RegionRank:5,Support:r.NoReply,Statement:"none"},{Name:"\tMichael McPake\t",Party:a.ScottishLabourParty,Region:i.CentralScotland,RegionOnly:!0,RegionRank:6,Support:r.NoReply,Statement:"none"},{Name:"\tPauline McNeill\t",Party:a.ScottishLabourParty,Region:i.Glasgow,RegionOnly:!0,RegionRank:1,Support:r.Yes,Statement:""},{Name:"\tAnas Sarwar\t",Party:a.ScottishLabourParty,Region:i.Glasgow,RegionOnly:!0,RegionRank:2,Support:r.Yes,Statement:"You have my full support in your campaign.

It states that conversion therapy, whether in relation to sexual orientation or gender identity, is unethical and potentially harmful. The MoU commits these organisations to making the risks of conversion therapy known to professionals and the public, and to ensuring that new and existing psychological therapists are appropriately trained to avoid these harmful practices1 . Our Calls We understand from the Scottish Government\u2019s correspondence to the Committee2 that it \u201cfully supports moves by the UK Government to end conversion therapy\u201d and that officials \u201care engaging with the UK Government as they develop proposals.\u201d As this is an area of policy which may touch both devolved and reserved responsibilities, we encourage the Scottish Government to continue working with the UK Government to ensure any proposals developed by the UK Government would be effective. However, we would request that the Public Petitions Committee call on the Scottish Government to commit to the following: \u2022 Take measures, within its devolved competence, to end conversion therapy in Scotland, if the UK Government does not make timely progress on ending (including banning) conversion therapy across the UK. \u2022 Take measures, within its devolved competence, to \u2018top up\u2019 any measures introduced by the UK Government to end conversion therapy, if these measures would be insufficient in effectively rooting out conversion therapy in all its forms."),s.a.createElement("h3",null,"Our Proposals"),s.a.createElement("h4",null,"Legislative Ban"),s.a.createElement("p",null,"Legislation should ban conversion therapy practices that take place in both the public and private sphere, including those performed by healthcare professionals and within faith communities. According to the UK Government\u2019s National LGBT Survey, most instances of conversion therapy in the UK (19 per cent and 51 per cent respectively) occur in these settings3 . A far-reaching ban is therefore necessary for legislation to be effective. There should be no restrictions on who is protected by the ban. Children and adults, deemed vulnerable or not, must be protected, including those who \u2018consented\u2019. A legislative ban should also include an equal level of protection for those who have been subject to conversion therapy based on sexual orientation or gender identity. This is particularly important given the finding of the National LGBT Survey that trans people were more likely to be offered or subjected to conversion therapies. Any intervention should begin from the understanding that conversion therapy is not neutral and is targeted at stopping LGBT people from being themselves. Supportive and affirming therapies that allow young people to explore and better understand their sexuality and gender identity should not be affected4. In line with recommendations by the UN, a ban must also include a prohibition on advertising the practice, establish a system of sanctions for non-compliance and a strong complaints mechanism5 .

It is crucial that we also establish a public complaints mechanism for reports of conversion therapy and ensure there is support for survivors as well as awareness training for both the healthcare sector and religious organisations.

Aside from the social impact of an ideology that views LGBT+ people as inferior, the evidence clearly shows that efforts to change sexual orientation or gender identity are ineffective and damaging to mental health. Practitioners of conversion 'therapy' often claim that what they really promote is freedom of lifestyle choice. However, this is a complete red herring. A ban on conversion 'therapy' in no way restricts the lifestyle choices of LGBT+ people. If an LGBT+ person wishes to live a lifestyle that differs from the majority of the LGBT+ community, whether for religious reasons or any other reason, that is their choice, no matter how the rest of us may feel about their choices. Nobody is saying that we have the right to control how people respond to their own identity, however we do have the right to ban pseudoscience where there is clear evidence of harm. Promotion of a false choice does not increase freedom of choice. So-called reparative therapy for sexual orientation, particularly the version targeted at gay men, has thankfully been losing public credibility in recent years, though of course a full and comprehensive ban on the practice is still needed. But I am particularly concerned by the increasing publicity given to a narrative promoted by anti-transgender groups that gender incongruence can be a 'social contagion', despite the clear evidence that gender identity forms at an early age and that it is just as immutable as sexual orientation. As a cisgender member of the LGBT+ community I recognise that anti-trans rhetoric is often just a recycling of old homophobic tropes, and we must fight for a world in which transphobia is no less unacceptable than homophobia. None of us are free until all of us are free."},{Name:"\tSheila Thomson\t",Party:a.ScottishLiberalDemocrats,Constituency:o.Rutherglen,RegionOnly:!1,Support:r.Yes,Statement:""},{Name:"\tBeatrice Wishart\t",Party:a.ScottishLiberalDemocrats,Constituency:o.Shetland,RegionOnly:!1,Support:r.NoReply,Statement:"none"},{Name:"\tDenis Rixson\t",Party:a.ScottishLiberalDemocrats,Constituency:o.SkyeLochaberAndBadenoch,RegionOnly:!1,Support:r.Yes,Statement:""},{Name:"\tFayzan Rehman\t",Party:a.ScottishLiberalDemocrats,Constituency:o.Stirling,RegionOnly:!1,Support:r.NoReply,Statement:"none"},{Name:"\tSusan Murray\t",Party:a.ScottishLiberalDemocrats,Constituency:o.StrathkelvinAndBearsden,Region:i.WestOfScotland,RegionOnly:!1,RegionRank:3,Support:r.Yes,Statement:"I support ending of the abusive practice of conversion therapy in Scotland using the devolved powers of the Scottish Government through legislation by the Scottish Parliament."},{Name:"\tKevin Stewart\t",Party:a.ScottishNationalParty,Constituency:o.AberdeenCentral,RegionOnly:!1,Support:r.Yes,Statement:"I am happy to sign your pledge."},{Name:"\tJackie Dunbar\t",Party:a.ScottishNationalParty,Constituency:o.AberdeenDonside,RegionOnly:!1,Support:r.Yes,Statement:"I am happy to support your campaign to put an end to conversion therapy."},{Name:"\tAudrey Nicoll\t",Party:a.ScottishNationalParty,Constituency:o.AberdeenSouthAndNorthKincardine,RegionOnly:!1,Support:r.NoReply,Statement:"none"},{Name:"\tGillian Martin\t",Party:a.ScottishNationalParty,Constituency:o.AberdeenshireEast,RegionOnly:!1,Support:r.Yes,Statement:"Happy to support your campaign to end conversion therapy."},{Name:"\tFergus Mutch\t",Party:a.ScottishNationalParty,Constituency:o.AberdeenshireWest,RegionOnly:!1,Support:r.YesWithCaveats,Statement:"There is no place for conversion therapy in Scotland.

It states that conversion therapy, whether in relation to sexual orientation or gender identity, is unethical and potentially harmful. The MoU commits these organisations to making the risks of conversion therapy known to professionals and the public, and to ensuring that new and existing psychological therapists are appropriately trained to avoid these harmful practices1 .

However, we would request that the Public Petitions Committee call on the Scottish Government to commit to the following: \u2022 Take measures, within its devolved competence, to end conversion therapy in Scotland, if the UK Government does not make timely progress on ending (including banning) conversion therapy across the UK. \u2022 Take measures, within its devolved competence, to \u2018top up\u2019 any measures introduced by the UK Government to end conversion therapy, if these measures would be insufficient in effectively rooting out conversion therapy in all its forms."),l.a.createElement("h3",null,"Our Proposals"),l.a.createElement("h4",null,"Legislative Ban"),l.a.createElement("p",null,"Legislation should ban conversion therapy practices that take place in both the public and private sphere, including those performed by healthcare professionals and within faith communities.

A far-reaching ban is therefore necessary for legislation to be effective. There should be no restrictions on who is protected by the ban. Children and adults, deemed vulnerable or not, must be protected, including those who \u2018consented\u2019. A legislative ban should also include an equal level of protection for those who have been subject to conversion therapy based on sexual orientation or gender identity. This is particularly important given the finding of the National LGBT Survey that trans people were more likely to be offered or subjected to conversion therapies. Any intervention should begin from the understanding that conversion therapy is not neutral and is targeted at stopping LGBT people from being themselves. Supportive and affirming therapies that allow young people to explore and better understand their sexuality and gender identity should not be affected4.
